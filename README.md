# RISCV-SOC-Tapeout
Open-source RISC-V System-on-Chip (SoC) design targeting tapeout, including RTL, verification, synthesis, and physical design flows. 

## Program Description
This initiative spotlights the RISC-V SoC chip tapeout program, jointly organized by VLSI System Design (VSD) and IIT Gandhinagar (IITGN). Spanning 20 weeks, the program provides practical exposure to a full tapeout cycle for a RISC‑V Reference SoC, making use of Synopsys tools and the SCL180 nm PDK. As part of India’s Semiconductor Mission, the program is dedicated to developing skilled VLSI engineers with a focus on real-world fabrication at national foundries (SCL). By fostering technical expertise, this effort is set to drive the next era of innovation in the country’s VLSI ecosystem(https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/soc-labs/)
